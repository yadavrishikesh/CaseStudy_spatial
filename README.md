# Exploring the Efficacy of Statistical and Deep Learning Methods for Large Spatial Datasets: A Case Study

This repository contains code developed for the **KAUST Competition on Large Spatial Datasets 2023**, the results of which were later published in the *Journal of Agricultural, Biological and Environmental Statistics*. The project focuses on handling large and complex spatial datasets by comparing several statistical and deep learning approaches. After thorough comparisons, we selected the **Vecchia approximation technique** for model fitting and implemented custom R functions to address limitations in existing packages, enabling zero-mean Gaussian processes and direct uncertainty estimation. We also incorporated subsampling-based approximations and parametric smoothing techniques. 

Our solutions led our team, **DesiBoys**, to secure top positions in multiple sub-competitions, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. For more details and access to the code, refer to the published version of the paper: [Hazra et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13253-024-00602-4).
